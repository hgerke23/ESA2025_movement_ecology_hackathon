    "text": "Dingo (Canis lupus dingo)\n\nDingoes (Canis lupus dingo) most likely arrived in Australia on boats from Asia at least 4,000 years ago [1–3]. Sometime after their introduction and adoption by indigenous Australians, dingoes became feral and have since occupied nearly every terrestrial habitat on the mainland [4]. Dingoes, like free-roaming dogs elsewhere, interact with humans and the water and food resources they provide either purposely or accidentally though refuse and artificial water points [5].\n\n*From Newsome et al.
